    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: person.your_name
        to: "home"
    action:
      - service: climate.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: climate.your_device_name
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id: climate.your_device_name
        data:
          temperature: 22
```

### Voice Control (Alexa/Google Home)

Just expose the climate entity in **Configuration** → **Alexa/Google Assistant**

Then say:
